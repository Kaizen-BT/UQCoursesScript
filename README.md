# UQCoursesScript
This script is a helper of sorts that is best used when you simply want to check what a course at UQ offers along with the nearest offering semester for the said course.
The script relies on a make-shift api (CourseAPI) that simply reaches out to the UQ course website and uses Bs4 to fetch the information we're interested in; namely, the course name, course description, and the nearest offering for the course.

Example usage: python3 Course.py <CourseCode>

The entire script has no error handling and is not to be used seriously. Please this was simply made as a challenge as I am very new to programming. If possible, kindly leave any feedback, it would be much appreciated. 
Thank you, kind regards
